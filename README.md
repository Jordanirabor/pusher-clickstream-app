## Tracking Clickstream Data With Pusher Channels

This is a demo repository for the tutorial where we build simple application that lets users purchase two items — burgers and chips. We further visualize users’ order preference and navigation information in an admin dashboard using Pusher Channels.

## Prerequisite
1. [Angular CLI]('https://angular.io/cli')
2. [Npm]('https://www.npmjs.com')
3. [Node]('https://nodejs.org')

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open two terminals.
3. In the first terminal: navigate into the `backend` directory and install dependencies then update your Pusher keys and start the development server - `node index.js`
4. In the second terminal: navigate into the `clickstream-app` directory and install dependencies then update your Pusher keys and start the development server - `ng serve --open`

## Testing
1. Once the servers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` on your web browser.
2. Open the admin dashboard on `/admin` and you will see your activities rendered as a bar chart in real-time as you interact with the user application.

## Built With
